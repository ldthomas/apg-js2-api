// This module is used by [`attributes.js`](./attributes.html) to determine rule dependencies
// (which rules are referenced by the given rule)
// and the attribute type of each rule.
// In general, rules are either recursive (the rule refers to itself)
// or non-recursive (the rule never refers to itself).
// However, for the purposes of determining these types, several refinements of these types are required.
//
// Sometimes it happens that several rules my refer to one another. e.g.
// ````
// S = "x" A / "y"
// A = "a" S / "b"
// ````
// These are called "mutually recursive sets".
// Note that within a mutually recursive set, each rule in the set refers to *all* other rules in the set
// directly or indirectly.
//Additionally, and important to the algorithms internally, are
// non-recursive rules that refer to mutually recursive sets, and simple recursive rules
// that refer to mutually recursive sets.
